/*
Difference of Volumes of Cuboids

In this simple exercise, you will create a program that will take two lists of integers, a and b. Each list will consist of 3 positive integers above 0, representing the dimensions of cuboids a and b. You must find the difference of the cuboids' volumes regardless of which is bigger.

For example, if the parameters passed are ([2, 2, 3], [5, 4, 1]), the volume of a is 12 and the volume of b is 20. Therefore, the function should return 8.

function findDifference(a, b) {
  let volumeA = 1;
  let volumeB = 1;
  
  for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    volumeA = volumeA * a[i];
    volumeB = volumeB * b[i];
  }
  
  return Math.abs(volumeA - volumeB);
